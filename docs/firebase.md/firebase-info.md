This file sets up and initializes Firebase for the Navigo app, enabling use of Firebase services such as Authentication, Firestore, and Analytics.

## ðŸ“¦ What the Code Does

- **Import Firebase SDK modules:**
  - `initializeApp` â€“ Initializes the Firebase application with provided config.
  - `getAnalytics` â€“ Enables Firebase Analytics to track user engagement.
  - `getAuth` â€“ Provides access to Firebase Authentication services (login, registration).
  - `getFirestore` â€“ Provides access to Firestore database services (for storing user data like points and inventory).

- **Firebase Configuration:**
  - Contains the appâ€™s unique Firebase credentials (`apiKey`, `projectId`, `appId`, etc.).
  - This configuration is specific to the Navigo project created on the Firebase Console.

- **Initialize Firebase App:**
  - `initializeApp(firebaseConfig)` bootstraps Firebase with the appâ€™s credentials.

- **Export Firebase services:**
  - `analytics` â€“ For tracking user behavior.
  - `auth` â€“ Used for login/signup with email, password, and Google sign-in.
  - `db` â€“ Used to read/write user data from Firestore.
  - `app` â€“ Default export for general access to the Firebase app instance.

**Note:**  
Never expose your Firebase credentials in public repositories. Use environment variables for sensitive data in production.
