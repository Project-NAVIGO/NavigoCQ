# How to Run Locally

This guide explains how to run the **NAVIGO** project on your local machine, including both backend and frontend servers.

---

## Start Backend

Navigate to the backend folder and start the server:

```bash title="Start Backend"
cd backend
npm run dev
```
This will start the Node.js + Express server at http://localhost:3000

## Start Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder and start the server
```bash title="Start Frontend"
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
This will start the React frontend at http://localhost:3000
After that you should be able to access the NAVIGO running locally.
