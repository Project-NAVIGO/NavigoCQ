# Team & Workflow

This document explains the team structure, workflow, and development methodology used for the NAVIGO.

---

## 1. Agile / SCRUM Methodology

NAVIGO was developed using Agile principles with SCRUM practices:

- Work is organized in sprints
- Daily stand-up meetings to track progress
- Sprint planning and retrospective meetings ensure continuous improvement
- Tasks are tracked using GitHub Issues and Github Actions

---

## 2. Branches, Commits, and Pull Requests

To maintain code quality and collaboration:
- Each feature or fix is developed in its own branch
- Commits are small and descriptive
- Pull Requests are used to merge changes into the main branch
  - Every pull request is reviewed by at least one team member

---

Using this workflow we have:
- Clear task distribution
- Consistent code quality
- Collaborative development
- Rapid and safe deployment of features
